# Drivers of MLB Attendance: Is Winning Worth It?

## Overview

**Drivers of MLB Attendance: Is Winning Worth It?** is a data science project focused on building machine learning models to predict attendance for Major League Baseball (MLB) games. The project leverages historical attendance records and gameplay statistics to develop predictive models by team.

## Project Goals

- Predict game-by-game MLB attendance using machine learning.
- Analyze how gameplay statistics, team performance, and other factors impact fan attendance.
- Provide actionable insights for teams, analysts, and sports economists.

## Approach

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather historical MLB attendance data.
   - Collect gameplay and team statistics from publicly available sources.

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Clean and merge datasets.
   - Engineer relevant features (e.g., team performance, weather, promotions).

3. **Model Development**
   - Train regression models to predict attendance (e.g., linear regression, random forest, etc.).
   - Evaluate models using metrics such as RMSE and RÂ².

4. **Analysis and Insights**
   - Interpret model outputs.
   - Visualize factors most correlated with attendance.

## Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tpriddick/mlb_machine_learning.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies (see requirements or notebook cells).
3. Run Jupyter notebooks or scripts to reproduce the analysis.

## Results

- The main deliverable is a model capable of predicting MLB game attendance based on a variety of features.
- See notebooks and output files for results, visualizations, and evaluation.
